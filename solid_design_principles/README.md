# Solid Design Principles

These 5 principles are introduced by Robert C. Martin( uncle Robert)

## Compile

`$cmake . && make`

## Run

`#./Open_closed_principle`

## Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have single reason to change( one primary responsibility)

Separation of concerns : different classes handle different, independent tasks/problems

## Open-Closed Principle

A class should open for extension but closed for modification

## Liskov Substition Principle

You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype

## Interface Segregation Principle

Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces

YAGNI- You Ain't Going to Need It

## Dependency Inversion Principle
High level modules should not depend upon low level ones; use abstractions(interface)
